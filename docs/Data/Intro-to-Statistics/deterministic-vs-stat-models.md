# Deterministic vs Statistical models

## Deterministic Models

As scientists and engineers, we work to explain nature through abstract mathematical
models.

- $F = ma$ (Force = Mass $\times$ Acceleration)
- $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ (Kinetic energy = $\frac{1}{2}$ mass * velocity$^2$)

**Deterministic Model**:

- A model that always produces the same output when the inputs are the same.

## Is Nature Deterministic?

In the real world, **variability** exists.

- Consider the gasoline mileage performance of your car. Do you always get exactly the same mileage performance on every tank of fuel?

- Sources of variability:
    - type of driving: city vs highway
    - conditions of the vehicle: tire inflation, engine compression, $\ldots$
    - type of gasoline
    - etc.

## Statistical Models

- \textcolor{red}{Probabilistic/stochastic/statistical modeling} are used to help us describe and understand **variability**. 
    - By variability, successive observations of a system or phenomenon do not produce exactly the same result. 

- Statistical models introduce an additional term into the mathematical model to account for variability.
