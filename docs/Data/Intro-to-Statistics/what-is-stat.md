- **Statistics** is the science of data, the art and science of collecting, organizing, summarizing, and analyzing data to draw conclusion or answer question.

- To make conclusions to these investigations, \textcolor{red}{data is used as evidence} to support or refute one or more claims.

- Because \textcolor{red}{all data experience some variability} (e.g., genetically identical wheat plants yield different amounts of grain or patients respond differently to the same drug), we must learn to address this variability and understand how it influences our decisions.
